			<p>The NBA is full of players who got better. Giannis is growing as a player who is an interior force and will always need to be pressured when going against on defense. Pascal Siakam is a player who won the 2019 Most Improved Player award, and there's no signs of him stopping his growth there. Luka Doncic was the 2019 Rookie of the Year and his growth into his sophomore year has been remarkable. Zion and Bol Bol and Ja have all been drafted this year and is currently in their Rookie years in the league. Zion is a marketable athlete who came from University of Duke and was the 1st draft pick. Bol Bol is someone who nobody even thought could be as good as he is today, and Ja Morant shocked people when he dominated the race of the Rookie of the Year's since Zion was out for a majority of the season due to injuries.</p>
